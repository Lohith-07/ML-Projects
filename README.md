🤖 Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository!
This repo contains beginner-to-intermediate level projects aimed at building end-to-end ML pipelines for real-world problems. Each project includes EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and conclusions.

📁 Projects
1. 🛍️ Customer Purchase Prediction

Goal: Predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and financial features.

Dataset: Shop.csv (simulated / open source).

Tech Stack: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Label Encoding, Scaling, Streamlit.

Highlights:

Feature preprocessing & encoding

EDA using Seaborn & Matplotlib

Model comparison (Logistic vs Naive Bayes)

Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall/F1

2. 🚗 Car Price Prediction

Goal: Predict the price of a car based on its specifications (engine, horsepower, torque, etc.).

Dataset: 1,000 car records with 8 features.

Tech Stack: Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

Highlights:

EDA (distributions, correlations, scatterplots, boxplots)

Regression modeling (MLR & Random Forest)

Cross-validation for robustness

Insights into strongest predictors (Horsepower, Torque, Engine Size)
