🤖 Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repo contains beginner-friendly projects aimed at building end-to-end ML pipelines for real-world problems.

📁 Projects
1. 🛍️ Customer Purchase Prediction

Goal: Predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on their gender, age, and estimated salary.

Dataset: Shop.csv (simulated or from open sources)

Tech Stack:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes Classifier

Label Encoding

Standard Scaling

Seaborn & Matplotlib for EDA

Streamlit (for optional web app)

Project Highlights:

Feature preprocessing and encoding

Visual exploratory data analysis

Model building and comparison

Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1

2. 🚗 Car Price Prediction

Goal: Predict the price of a car based on technical specifications like engine size, horsepower, torque, and acceleration.

Dataset: Car dataset (1,000+ entries with 8 key features).

Tech Stack:

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

Random Forest Regressor

Cross-validation

Seaborn & Matplotlib for EDA

Project Highlights:

Comprehensive EDA (correlation heatmap, scatterplots, distribution plots, boxplots)

Regression modeling and comparison (MLR vs Random Forest)

Cross-validation for robustness (MLR ~0.94 R² vs RF ~0.91 R²)

Key predictors identified: Horsepower, Torque, Engine Size

🧰 Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn

streamlit (for deployment in some projects)
